### Homelab

My Homelab is used, both as a lab, where I tinker and experiment.
But it is also used to self-host sevices that I use in my everyday life,
such as Home Assistant and Samba shares.

## Setup
### Networking
- Unifi Cloud Gateway Ultra
- Unifi Switch Ultra PoE
- Unifi U6

My network is segmented into VLANs with strict firewall rules. Devices on the IoT network are not allowed to access devices on other VLANs as an example.

I own a Cloudflare domain that I use internally.
All of my subdomains internal DNS records point to the IP of my Traefik instance, which the directs the request to the corresponding service.

```subdomain.maindomain.net -> DNS -> Traefik -> Service ```

The Cloud Gateway runs a WireGuard VPN server so that I can securely access services remotely.

### Proxmox Server
I run Proxmox on a Minisforum UN150P mini PC
- Intel N150
- 16GB RAM
- 512GB SSD
- 4TB External drive

[harpoon.zsh](https://github.com/Alexandoooor/harpoon) is a small zsh script that allows hooking paths to aliases
in order to be able to quickly jump between them.

I find this useful as I often encounter situations in my workflow where I jump back and forth between a few directories.
Hooking these directories to short aliases is much easier than having to remember and reference the full path of each directory when running `cd`.

When attaching a hook, the script associates a given name with the path of the current working directory,
which is saved to a file. This name can then be referenced to quickly jump to the corresponding path.

### Harpoon usage

#### Commands:

    hook <name>         add a hook <name> for the current directory
    jump <name>         cd to the directory referenced by <name>
    unhook <name>       remove hook <name>
    hooks               list current hooks
    harpoon             print this message

#### Example usage:

```
cd ~/projects/myapp
hook app
```
```
cd ~
jump app  # instantly back to ~/projects/myapp
```

```
hooks     # list all hooks
```

```
unhook app # remove the hook
```
